### Objectives
---
By the end of this laboratory session, you should be able to do the following.
* Understand the different mask layers that make up the layout of an inverter.
* Manually extract the circuit schematic of a 12-transistors logic gate from its layout.
* Import a Verilog netlist into Virtuoso as a schematic.
* Use Cadence's Virtuoso tool to perform manual floorplanning and placement.
* Use Cadence's Virtuoso tool to perform manual routing.
* Use Cadence's Calibre tool to verify that your layout obeys design rules through DRC.
* Use Cadence's Calibre tool to verify that your layout is the same as the schematic.

### Task 1 - Deep Dive into Inverter Layout (30 minutes)
---
The purpose of this task is to understand the different mask layers that make up a simple inverter from the layout.  This helps you to appreciate the fabrication process and the physical aspect of VLSI design.
